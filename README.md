# hcsbootcamp2 API assignment
We were interested in seeing how goalkeeper statistics are determined by soccer video game creators, which is why we created an API related to "GK Statistics + Height" using data from the FIFA 19 video game. We used a public dataset that included all statistics and physical characteristics of players on the game. Overall, we thought it would be interesting to see how height might be affected by GK statistics because taller players are usually assumed to be more successful as goalkeepers in real life.
